>Â *Hello everyone, this is KyloNeko and I am here with a guide to help you get started on Linux! This is a guide that is intended to be a way for Vtubers to want to be able to move away from Windows (or Mac) or people who were not too keen on the Windows Recall feature. I hope this guide helps a lot of people out as it took me a while to switch over and get things worked out, but trust me it works out correctly as I have done a lot of testing on Linux with various applications that I daily drive. If you need help finding a Linux distro that you intend to use long term or test you can use [Distro Sea](https://distrosea.com/) to help you figure this out. Once you have selected your flavor of distro you can then proceed to the next step.*
