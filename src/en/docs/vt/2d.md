For 2D VTubing, you have a few options:

:::: info 2D VTubing Options

::: info Live2D
Live2D is the most popular and widely used option for 2D VTubing. Live2D models are widely supported by tracking applications that run on Linux, such as VTube Studio. 
:::

::: info Innochi2D
Innochi2D is an open-source alternative to Live2D. It is still in development and not at a 1.0 release yet, so it may have some bugs or missing features. Innochi2D has separate model creation software from Live2D, so you cannot use Live2D models in Innochi2D or vice versa.
:::

::: info PNG Tuber
PNG Tubers use a single or image, or a handful of edited version of an image, with a program to warp, move, and transform the image in response to audio. This option is the easiest to make and set up but has the most limitations.

## Live2D & VTube Studio

[VTube Studio](https://vtubestudio.com/) by denchi is the most popular Live2D tracking application. It supports webcam and iPhone face tracking, as well as audio lip-syncing. VTube Studio is a Windows application, but it runs well on Linux using Proton (see the [Running Windows Software on Linux](../linux/running_win_software.md) more information).

Installation is straightforward. After setting up Steam and Proton, you can install VTube Studio from Steam. After installation, you need to copy [this file](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/DenchiSoft/122729d9a0bd0f96798bea28bfe146d6/raw/9e419880bb77e60afa8d41b1504bcb41550b8985/ip.txt) to streaming assets folder. You can now use VTube Studio on Linux with some restrictions.

If you have problems launching VTube Studio, try forcing usage of Proton 9.0-4 from Compatibility settings in Steam (right click VTube Studio in your library, go to Properties -> Compatibility):

::: tip
The file is directly from DenchiSoft, the developer of VTube Studio. It allows VTube Studio to listen for connection from external tracking software, such as VSeeFace.
