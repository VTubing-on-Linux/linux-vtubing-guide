# Hardware

## Computers

Most modern desktops and laptops with a dedicated GPU (NVIDIA or AMD) work well for on Linux. Look for at least 16GB RAM and a recent multi-core processor. Linux compatibility is best with hardware that has good open-source driver support. Linux likes AMD hardware more than NVIDIA, but both work fine. You might need to install proprietary drivers for the best performance, especially with NVIDIA GPUs.
