# Getting Started

If you're new to Linux, the idea of switching from Windows or macOS can be daunting. However, with a bit of preparation and the right resources, you can make the transition smoothly. Here are some steps to help you get started:

## Familiarize Yourself with Linux Terminology
Understanding basic Linux terms and concepts will make your transition easier. Here are some key terms to know:

- **Distribution (Distro)**: A version of Linux that includes the Linux kernel and other software. Examples include Ubuntu, Fedora, SUSE and Arch Linux (that's why you see the `I use arch btw.` memes).
- **Terminal**: A command-line interface used to interact with the operating system. Many tasks can be performed more efficiently in the terminal than in a graphical interface.
- **Package Manager**: A tool used to install, update, and remove software packages. Each Linux distribution has its own package manager (e.g., APT for Ubuntu, DNF for Fedora, Zypper for openSUSE, Pacman for Arch Linux). Sometimes, you might also see something like `snap` or `flatpak`, which are universal package managers that work across different distributions. 
- **Desktop Environment (DE)**: The graphical interface you interact with on your Linux system. Popular desktop environments include GNOME, KDE Plasma, XFCE, and Cinnamon. Each has its own look and feel, so you can choose one that suits your preferences.

There are many Linux distributions available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. We recommend PikaOS for beginners, as it is user-friendly and has a strong community. Other popular choices include Ubuntu, Linux Mint, and Fedora. The Getting Started part of this document will focus on PikaOS.

## Hardware

Most modern desktops and laptops with a dedicated GPU (NVIDIA or AMD) work well for on Linux. Look for at least 16GB RAM and a recent multi-core processor. Linux compatibility is best with hardware that has good open-source driver support. Linux likes AMD hardware more than NVIDIA, but both work fine. You might need to install proprietary drivers for the best performance, especially with NVIDIA GPUs.
