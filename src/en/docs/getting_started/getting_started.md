# Getting Started

If you're new to Linux, the idea of switching from Windows or macOS can be daunting. However, with a bit of preparation and the right resources, you can make the transition smoothly. Here are some steps to help you get started:

## Familiarize Yourself with Linux Terminology
Understanding basic Linux terms and concepts will make your transition easier. Here are some key terms to know:

- **Distribution (Distro)**: A version of Linux that includes the Linux kernel and other software. Examples include Ubuntu, Fedora, SUSE and Arch Linux (that's why you see the `I use arch btw.` memes).
- **Terminal**: A command-line interface used to interact with the operating system. Many tasks can be performed more efficiently in the terminal than in a graphical interface.
- **Package Manager**: A tool used to install, update, and remove software packages. Each Linux distribution has its own package manager (e.g., APT for Ubuntu, DNF for Fedora, Zypper for openSUSE, Pacman for Arch Linux). Sometimes, you might also see something like `snap` or `flatpak`, which are universal package managers that work across different distributions.

## Choose the Right Distribution: 

There are many Linux distributions available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Before fully committing to Linux, consider setting up a test environment. You can do this by:

- Creating a bootable USB drive to try a live session of Linux without installing it.
- Installing Linux alongside your existing operating system (dual-boot). 
- Using a virtual machine (e.g., VirtualBox) to run Linux within your current OS. (Advanced)


For beginners, recommended distributions include:

*   [**Ubuntu**](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) - One of the most popular and user-friendly distributions, based on Debian.
*   [**Pop OS**](https://system76.com/pop/) - A distribution based on Ubuntu, designed for gaming and creative professionals.
*   [**Fedora**](https://getfedora.org/) - Made by Red Hat, known for its cutting-edge features and strong community support.
*   [**Linux Mint**](https://linuxmint.com/download.php) - Based on Ubuntu, known for its ease of use and traditional desktop layout.
*   [**Zorin OS**](https://zorin.com/os/download/) - Designed to be familiar for users coming from Windows

Go to the website of your chosen distribution and download the latest "Desktop" version. This will be an `.iso` (disk image) file.
